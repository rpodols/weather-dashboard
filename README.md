# Weather Dashboard - Challenge 6

This project is the sixth challenge of the coding bootcamp.

User Story: As a traveler, I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities, so that I can plan a trip accordingly. 

Starting from scratch, this challenge required writing code to do the following:
* when I search for a city, I am presented with current and future conditions, and that city is added to the search history
* when I view current weather conditions for that city, I am presented with the city name, date, and icon representation of weather conditions, temperature, wind speed, and UV index
* when I view the UV index, I am presented with a color that indicates the current condition
* when I view future weather conditions, I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays an icon representation of the weather conditions, the temperature, wind speed, and humidity
* when I click on a city in the search history, I am again presented with current and future conditions of that city

## Made Using:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
